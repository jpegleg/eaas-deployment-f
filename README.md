# eaas-deployment-f
An api template, add new nodes to kubernetes cluster automation with ansible for Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Kali, etc)

I have many of these variations, f is the next one I'm doing on github.
EaaS deployment f features a single Apache webserver
with mpm-prefork web cgi program exectuion. There is a demo
encryption-as-a-service included, you would replace those with your actual API etc.


More of what this repo is about is the installation of a 3 node kubernetes cluster
with a calico network, and a template for deploying microservices
within it.

See more examples of these templates:
